# Introductory Lessons

To prepare students for the team assignments and legacy code projects in this course, we hold mini-lectures about the following topics to build up enough knowledge to meaningfully contribute.

Many of these tutorials are aided by the "Rational" tutorials on GitHub, which is a repo containing various versions of a Java Spring Boot application, each one designed to illustrate a specific concept as described on the tutorial website.

* [Student "Rational" Tutorial Website](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/tutorials/student/)
* [Student "Rational" Tutorial GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/student-tutorial)

The topics covered in introductory mini-lectures include:

* Git branching
  * What are branches used for?
  * How do we establish new branches in GitHub
  * How do we pull and push branches? What does "pulling" and "pushing" mean?
* GitHub branches and pull requests
  * How do we create a pull request?
  * What is a pull request actually doing?
* Unit testing and code coverage with JUnit
  * How do we test Java code?
  * How do we ensure that all branches of code have been covered?
* Mutation testing with Pitest
  * How can code coverage be "falsified"? How does mutation testing solve this problem?
  * What is mutation testing and how does it work?
* Backend REST Architecture / Spring Boot Controllers
  * What is an API? What is REST?
  * What's the difference between GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE?
  * What are HTTP status codes and what do they mean?
* Introduction to JavaScript and React
  * How can we render HTML in JavaScript using React?
  * What is a React component? What is the architecture of a React application?
  * How do we talk to the backend in React?
* OAuth
  * What is OAuth? How do we set it up?
* Standups and Retrospectives
  * What's the purpose of a standup and how does a team perform one?
  * What's the purpose of a retrospective and how does a team perform one?

These topics can be covered either in a short face-to-face lecture during an instructional period, or asynchronously via a pre-recorded lecture uploaded to GauchoCast (mainly for the more technical content). This class, in a way, loosely follows the "flipped classroom" model, where instructional content is either limited or presented via video, and class time is mostly reserved for interactive exercises and team work.
