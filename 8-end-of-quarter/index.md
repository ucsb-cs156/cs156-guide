# End of Quarter Activities

## Assign students to make Videos

## Set up deployments in preparation for evaluations

## Pre/Post Survey

## Written Final Exam (take home) on Gradescope

## Evaluations (done synchonrously during the final exam slot)

During the final exam slot, we assign the students to do an activity where they evaluate each of the other apps.

This is typically synchronous, with in-person attendance encouraged, but not required.

Encourage folks to bring headphones/earbuds.

It's tempting to make it also asynchronous.  But a few reasons not to:
* Students will put it off to the end of the week.
* If there's a problem with a deployment, you want to find out and try to fix it in real time.
* The chat is a part of the activity
