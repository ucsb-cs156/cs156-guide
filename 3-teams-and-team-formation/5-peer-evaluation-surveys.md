# CATME Peer Evaluation Surveys

Occasionally throughout the course after students begin to code as a team (i.e. in the first team programming assignment), students will be asked to anonymously evaluate each of their team members' performance. This provides students one way to start a conversation within their team about individual team members' performance, as well as alert the staff of any potential issues down the line.

To assist with the peer evaluation process, we utilize CATME's Peer Evaluation tool. This tool consists of an occasional survey where students will be presented with five "teamwork dimensions", which are key performance areas that are typically measured within group environments. 

Students will rate other students on their team in each dimension in a five-point scale. After all responses are collected, students' average ratings in each category will be made available for viewing, along with an adjustment factor reflecting the student's relative performance in the team. These can then serve as discussion topics in the team's next standup or retrospective meeting.

The five "teamwork dimensions" that CATME analyzes are:

* Contributing to the Team's Work
* Interacting with Teammates
* Keeping the Team on Track
* Expecting Quality
* Having Relevant Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities

The description of each point ranking in each dimension is viewable on CATME's [Five Teamwork Dimensions website](https://info.catme.org/features/catme-five-dimensions/).

## Peer Evaluation Timing

The CATME Peer Evaluation survey is administered **three times** throughout the course:

1. Once after team01 (the first team assignment)
2. Once after team03 (the last team assignment before the legacy code project)
3. Once after the legacy code project (i.e. the end of the course)

The first two CATME Peer Evaluation surveys are *purely informational*. While completion of the surveys themselves counts as a participation grade, the results of the first two surveys will not have any impact on a student's grade. When reviewing results, students should be instructed to identify new goals for the team in the next "sprint" based on the evenness of each member's contributions. They should also be informed that the final CATME Peer Evaluation survey *does* have an effect on the student's final grade.

## Final CATME Survey

After the due date for legacy code project pull requests, the instructor should release the final CATME survey. The questions in this survey are identical to those in the first two, and students should approach it the same way. However, unlike the first two surveys, the results of this CATME survey *will* impact a student's final project grade.

Based on average rankings, each student is given an *adjustment factor* within the CATME interface. This is a decimal number at or close to 1.0 that reflects the performance of a student relative to that of their team members. **This number will be multiplied by the team's raw project grade (out of 100) to obtain each student's final project category score.** The goal of this adjustment factor is to account for cases where one team member contributes to a much lesser degree than all other team members.
