# Section Swaps

Prior to teams being finalized on the first or second instructional period of the class, students may request to swap sections with another member of the class. Section swaps may be requested for any reason, including personal preference, but the main reason for section swaps is to avoid a conflict with another course the student is enrolled in.

Due to the synchronous nature of this course, **it is unacceptable for a student in this course to have a course conflict for any reason**. Instructors can view students with conflicting courses through the Registrar. Students in this position must either have their section swapped to one where they will not have any course conflict (if the conflict occurs with a section) or drop one of the conflicting courses entirely. The instructor should drop anyone who fails to resolve any course conflict, as the lack of synchronous participation will hold the student and their team back.

## #section-swaps Slack Channel

Section swaps are facilitated by the creation of a #section-swaps Slack channel that students are free to join / use prior to the first day. If a student wishes to have their section time swapped:

1. The student should join the #section-swaps Slack channel after accepting their Slack invitation through the GauchoSpace Welcome MEssage
2. Students should first look to see if any existing request is the exact *inverse* of their own desired request. (For example, if student A wants to move from 4 PM to 5 PM, and a request for student B already exists for 5 PM to 4 PM)
   1. If an exact inverse request exists and has not been "claimed", the student should "claim" the request by responding in the message thread stating they want to swap with the requester and @mention the instructor.
   2. The instructor will confirm the request with both parties over Slack DM and send add codes as necessary.
3. If a student cannot find an exact inverse request, they should start their own request by posting a Slack message stating their current and desired section times.

If a student urgently needs to have their section swapped due to a section conflict, they should make that known to the instructor. Since the instructor has final approval over all section requests, they can choose to prioritize requests from students with conflicts over students who want to switch for personal preferences.
