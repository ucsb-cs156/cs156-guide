# CATME

CATME is a set of research-based tools designed to help instructors better form and evaluate student teams. Usage of CATME in CMPSC 156 involves the following two tools:

1. **CATME Peer Evaluation** (i.e. the original "Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness") 

    This tool allows students to anonymously rate team members performance across CATME's five "teamwork dimensions", which include contributions, interactions, progress toward goals, quality, and skills / knowledge. Instructors can use these metrics to identify teams that need more support.

2. **CATME Team Maker**

    This tool allows instructors to create a survey of questions about criteria for which the instructor wishes to use to form a team. After student responses are collected, based on custom instructor weights, CATME will automatically form an optimal set of teams.

The CATME suite of tools is developed by Purdue University and is backed by various NSF grants. Information about the CATME project is available on their [website](https://info.catme.org/).
