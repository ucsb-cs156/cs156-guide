# Team Mentors

After student teams are formed, each team is assigned a student mentor, who is a member of the course staff (i.e. TA or ULA). This member of the course staff will generally be responsible for the following:

* Acting as the first point of contact for any questions within the team
* Monitoring the team's Slack channel for questions
* Grading class participation activities for the team
* Live-grading team programming assignments for the team
* Establishing epics for the legacy code project the team will be building on
* Reviewing pull requests from the team in the legacy code project

Assuming that the staff present at every section is the same, mentors are generally assigned by team number. In other words, if each section has four teams suffixed with `-1`, `-2`, `-3`, and `-4`, staff will be assigned all the teams ending with a given suffix. The staff are also generally assigned in alphabetical order by first name.

For example, in Spring 2022:

* Andrew L. served as the assigned mentor for all teams ending in `-1`
* Andrew P. served as the assigned mentor for all teams ending in `-2`
* Bryan Z. served as the assigned mentor for all teams ending in `-3`
* Kevin H. served as the assigned mentor for all teams ending in `-4`
