# Visual Studio Code

Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free and open-source code editor built on Chromium. It includes built-in support for a variety of languages and tools, including all of those used in this class (JavaScript, React, Java, SQL, git / GitHub) and has a large catalog of extensions that can be installed to provide additional framework support or otherwise enhance the development experience.

Visual Studio Code was introduced to CSIL in 2019, and is now the preferred code editor for this course. It can be downloaded on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, or used on the web (with limited features) on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/) or [github.dev](https://github.dev/).

According to [Stack Overflow's 2022 Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#most-popular-technologies-new-collab-tools-learn), Visual Studio Code is the most popular development environment across all developers, with 74.48% of all respondents and 81.04% of those learning to code using VS Code. We encourage students to use VS Code as their text editor to align our course with industry standards.
