It is helpful to add a Bookmarks tab to each team channel. Here's how:

## What can you add to the bookmarks tab

It's helpful during the legacy code phase, to have links to both the Open PRs as well as the Merged PRs.

Here's how to add those links.

1. In github, open the PR pages for the repo and copy the link.
2. In slack, click to add a new Bookmark for "Open PRs".
3. In github, go back and edit the criteria from `open` to `merged` and copy the resulting URL
4. In slack, click to add a new Bookmark for "Merged PRs (earned points)"
