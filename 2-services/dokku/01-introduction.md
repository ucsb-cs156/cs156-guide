# Dokku

Dokku is an open source replacement for Heroku that can run on UCSB ECI hardware.

## Why Dokku?

Heroku stopped offering a free tier, and the student tier was not particularly useful for CS156 projects.

1. Dokku supports deploying webapps from Docker containers
2. Dokku has a Postgres database add-on
3. Dokku has a MongoDB database add-on

## Adding dokku users

Authorized users can edit a file called `/home/eci/dokku_users_list` on dokku-00.
