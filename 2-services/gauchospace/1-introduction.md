# GauchoSpace

[GauchoSpace](https://gauchospace.ucsb.edu/courses/) is UCSB's Learning Management System (LMS), built on the Moodle platform. While GauchoSpace is often used as a home for all course material in other courses, we do not place any course content on the GauchoSpace page aside from GauchoCast videos, as all course information is publicly available on our [website](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/).

In this course, GauchoSpace is used for:

* Initial class-wide email announcements
* Official course roster (for everyone other than the instructor)
* Student gradebook
* Manually-graded jpa and team assignment submissions
* Final presentation submission

**Note that GauchoSpace is currently in the process of being deprecated in favor of [Canvas](http://ucsb.instructure.com/)**, which will serve as the new LMS system for the UCSB campus going forward. This is due to breaking changes in Moodle 4.0 and the end of support for Moodle 3.9 in 2023.

CMPSC 156 will use Canvas in [Fall 2022](https://ucsb.instructure.com/courses/2369).
