To assist in setting up projects (Kanban boards), we have created a custom github action.

* <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-m23/project-creator/blob/main/.github/workflows/20-create-project.yml>

Individual issues can be populated with a script such as this one:

* <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-m23/STARTER-team01/blob/main/.github/workflows/99-team01.yml>
