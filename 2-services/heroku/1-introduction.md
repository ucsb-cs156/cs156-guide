# Heroku

Heroku is a deployment platform that allows developers to deploy stateless apps and host / run them in the cloud. In this class, Heroku is used to introduce the notion of QA and Production deployments and manage application deployments for those two environments respectively. 

## Why Heroku?

Heroku was chosen as the deployment platform for this class for a variety of reasons:

1. Heroku has a free tier that can be used by students without the need to enter a credit card
   * There are some limitations to this approach - see the corresponding document
2. Heroku deployments can be shared and used by multiple students, allowing for easy access for entire teams and the course staff
3. Heroku has a robust GitHub integration, allowing for one-click deploys of any branch on a repository, as well as automatic deployments from a main branch
4. Heroku has built-in support for a variety of tech stacks, and has supported every tech stack used in this course
5. Heroku has a free Postgres database add-on that requires no additional setup, which is currently used as our persistent database for deployed applications
